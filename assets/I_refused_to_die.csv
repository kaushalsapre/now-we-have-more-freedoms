When I refused to die
My chains were loosened.
I came out
Into the vast meadows
smiling at the leaves of grass.
My smile caused intolerance in them.
I was shackled again.
When I defied death again
tired of my life
my captors released me.
I walked out
into the lush green valleys
under the rising sun
smiling at the tossing blades of grass.
Infuriated by my undying smile
they captured me again.
I still stubbornly refuse to die.
The sad thing is that
they donâ€™t know how to kill me
because I love so much
the sounds of growing grass.
