On that day
when Rohit Vemula
hanged himself
and declared:
‘I can’t be reduced to my identity’,
my heart missed its beats.

On that day
when Perumal Murugan
announced:
‘the writer in me is dead’,
I was afflicted with sleep apnoea.

On that day
when Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar
pronounced:
‘The Adivasi Will not Dance’,
my muscles contracted.

On that day
when Hadiya
standing on her ground
in the courtroom was compelled to
beg:

‘I want freedom’,

I ceased to breathe

in my prison cell.
